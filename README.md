Friday Challenge #3
====================

The challenge is writing an air traffic control program for airplanes. It’s like a mini Boris Bikes assignment with a bit of a twist. The assignment is like this:

The planes can land and take off provided that the weather is sunny. Occasionally it may be stormy, in which case no planes can land or take off. 

Our task is to create a set of classes/modules to makes the given test suite pass. We will need to use random number generator to set the weather (it is normally sunny but on rare occasions it may be stormy). In our tests, we’ll need to use a double to override random weather. Finally, every plane must have a status indicating whether it’s flying or landed.
